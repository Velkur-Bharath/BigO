# BigO
This is an open source repository of topic "BigO notations" which covers Time and Space complexity.<br>
It was written using C++ language.<br>
It is highly recommended to go-through all the code to get a better understanding about BigO notations.<br> 
You are always welcome to contribute to this repository.

<h2>Rules of BigO:</h2><br>
<p1>a) BigO always considers the worst cases.<br>
b) Remove the Constants<br>
c) 1.If n and m are nested then the BigO notation is O(n*m).<br>
   2.If n and m are followed by each other in an order, it is O(n+m) notation.<br>
d) Always drop non dominant terms. for example in O(n+n^2) n^2 is pretty dominant upon n so n is neglected. Thus the notation is O(n^2).<br></p1>
